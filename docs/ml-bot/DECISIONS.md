# Decisions — ML / Self-Play Bot

Lightweight ADR (Architecture Decision Record) log. Each entry: the decision, the
context, why, and the alternatives rejected. Add an entry at each real
fork-in-the-road. Supersede rather than delete — keep the history.

## D-1 — Search first, learning second · Accepted (2026-06-21)

**Decision.** Build a pure-JS chance-node search bot (Track A) _before_ investing
in self-play RL (Track B), and gate every step on `arena:sweep` vs `ai_strategist`.

**Why.** `ai_strategist` is a strong exact-odds baseline. Prior art on this game
class (KTH Risk AlphaZero/ExIt thesis; Moy & Shekh hex-wargaming) shows naive
self-play RL losing to good heuristics until bootstrapped. Search reuses the eval
and odds we already have, likely wins in days, and tells us early whether the
problem is even tractable before spending GPU-weeks.

**Rejected.** Jumping straight to RL — high cost, high risk of plateauing at or
below the heuristic with no cheap early signal.

## D-2 — Model-free PPO, not AlphaZero / MuZero · Accepted (2026-06-21)

**Decision.** If we train a learned bot, use **self-play PPO with action masking**
(SB3 MaskablePPO first; CleanRL/RLlib for leagues).

**Why.** The game is **stochastic** (dice = chance nodes) **and 8-player
free-for-all** (not 2-player zero-sum). PPO absorbs dice variance natively, handles
N agents via parameter sharing, and consumes the `getValidMoves` mask directly.

**Rejected.**

- `alpha-zero-general` — hard-coded 2-player/deterministic/perfect-info.
- `muzero-general` — explicitly lists >2 players _and_ stochasticity as
  unsupported; and MuZero's model-learning is wasted when we already have a fast
  exact simulator.
- OpenSpiel bundled AlphaZero — game layer supports chance + multiplayer, but the
  _trainer_ is 2-player-zero-sum only.

## D-3 — JS engine is the single source of truth; Python for training only · Accepted (2026-06-21)

**Decision.** Keep the game engine in JS. Bridge to Python for _training only_ via
a PettingZoo AEC env (subprocess/socket) wrapping the existing arena harness.

**Why.** The JS engine is the product. Re-porting it to Python duplicates logic
and invites drift (the trained bot would play a subtly different game than it
ships into).

**Rejected.**

- Port the engine to Python (fastest training, but drift risk on the product).
- Pure-tfjs training (avoids the bridge, but slow training + DIY RL ecosystem).

**Open risk.** The subprocess/socket bridge adds per-step IPC latency that can
dominate wall-clock — mitigate with many parallel env workers and a compact
(non-JSON-per-step) state. Revisit if throughput is unacceptable.

## D-4 — Deploy via ONNX Runtime Web · Accepted (2026-06-21)

**Decision.** Train in PyTorch → export to ONNX → run in-browser inference via
ONNX Runtime Web, wrapped as a normal `(BotState) → {from,to}|null` bot.

**Why.** It's the robust, future-proof deployment path and keeps the shipped bot a
first-class in-browser bot like every other. A small MLP/GNN policy is trivially
WASM-fast. **TensorFlow.js** is the fallback (pure-JS deploy, or no-Python
train+infer for a small net).

---

## D-5 — Evaluation gate = `arena:sweep` vs `ai_strategist` with CIs · Accepted (2026-06-21)

**Decision.** "Better" means a statistically significant win-rate/ELO edge over
`ai_strategist` on multi-seed `arena:sweep`, controlling seat/turn-order.

**Why.** Battles are high-variance (dice). Single-seed results are noise.
Turn-order is shuffled, so seat effects must be controlled to measure skill, not
first-mover luck.

## D-Encoding — MDP / state / action / reward shape · Proposed (2026-06-21)

**Proposed (finalize in Phase 2).**

- **State:** graph over ≤31 territory nodes (adjacency from `neighborAreaIds`);
  node features = owner, dice (1–8), is-mine, is-border, per-edge win-prob from
  `WIN_TABLE`; per-player globals dominated by largest-connected-group income.
- **Action:** policy head over legal `(from,to)` border edges **plus an explicit
  STOP**, masked by `getValidMoves` (a turn is a _sequence_ of single attacks, not
  one batched move). Edge/pointer head, not a flat 31×31 head.
- **Reward:** terminal win/placement + dense shaping (Δlargest-group income,
  territory/dice deltas, eliminations).
- **Self-play:** a single shared stateless policy over the per-player view; the
  engine handles whose-turn via `turnOrder`/`currentPlayerIndex`.

**Status:** to be validated empirically in Phase 2 (if a net can't _clone_
`ai_strategist` under this encoding, the encoding is wrong).
